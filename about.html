                            Agboola was called upon to join politics for the betterment of the people, whom he had always shown love, concern and care for. He started his political life as the Chairman, Social Democratic Party [SDP] in the old Apoi Ward 1 between 1988 and 1992. He steered the wheel of the party so perfectly and transparently that he gained the trust of his people. His political activities did not go unnoticed. Soon after and by unanimous choice of eminent Ondo State leaders, he was made the Secretary of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Ilaje/Ese-Odo local government are between 1998 and 1999 as a founding party member. Effortlessly, Agboola became a major force in the southern senatorial district of Ondo State. From the days of the Social Democratic Party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressive Congress (APC), Agboola Ajayi had always enjoyed the solid support of his people.
                              <br><br>Agboola’s service to the people began with his appointment as a Supervisor for Agriculture, Ese-Odo LGA, 1999-2001. In recognition of his excellent performance in office, he was appointed the Supervisor for Works and Transport, Ese-Odo Local Government between 2001 and 2003. In both capacities, he distinguished himself as hardworking, focused, committed and charitable. His performance was the needed springboard for higher responsibilities as his unprecedented feats in office earned him appointment as the Caretaker Chairman of Ese-Odo Local Government between 2003 and 2004. But Agboola’s victory as the dully elected Chairman of Ese-Odo Local Government Area in 2004 can be best described as the reward for his selfless and humanitarian services to his people. As Chairman, he served selflessly and meritoriously between 2004 and 2007. His virtues of uprightness, trustworthiness and accountability were appreciated and rewarded by his peers, who made him the Treasurer of Association of Local Government of Nigeria [ALGON], Ondo State Chapter between 2004 and 2007.<br><br>
                              Fulfillment of destiny is in the hands of God through the individual’s hardwork and dedication. Unsurprisingly, Agboola’s political journey took another dramatic turn in 2007, when he was elected to the Federal House of Representatives by the good people of Ilaje/Ese-Odo Federal constituency. To his people and teeming supporters which include political leaders, his former colleagues and party faithful, it was time to reward him with a higher position for a masses-focused service. At the National Assembly, Agboola Alfred Ajayi’s personal attributes and leadership abilities promoted him. He served as the Chairman, House Committee on NDDC between 2007 and 2010 and was a member of various committees, including House Committee on Gas, House Committee on Habitat, House Committee on Justice and House Committee on Industry between 2007 and 2011.<br><br>Due to his political ideology and his passion for Change Mantra and a belief that the drivers of the mantra were interested in truly changing the trajectory of governance to benefit the people, Agboola Ajayi joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) and became one of the most prominent members and elders state. Acknowledged for his peoples-oriented political philosophy and sterling record of electoral victories, APC picked Agboola as the running mate of Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, in the 2016 Ondo State gubernatorial election. It was a winning team and the rest is history as Agboola emerged Deputy Governor of the Sunshine State. It is on record that the election that brought Arakunrin Akeredolu and Hon. Agboola Ajayi was adjudged the best and most credible in the political history of Ondo State as its outcome was not contested at the Tribunal.<br><br>
                              Agboola is a dedicated community leader, kind-hearted philanthropist, compassionate, humanitarian, astute politician and a role model to this generation. Affectionately called Agbo at home, Agboola has had considerable positive impact on the people of his community and the Ondo State at large<br><br>
                              Hon. Alfred Agboola Ajayi is a committed family man, passionate husband and good father. His hobbies include sports development, traveling, meeting people and intellectual discourse.
